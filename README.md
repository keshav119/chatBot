# Neural Network & NLP Chatbot

This project is a simple chatbot implementation created with Python using Neural Network & Natural Language Processing. This was done mainly for the purpose of learning on how Neural Networks function and how NLP is done.

## Setup
- Setup a python venv.

- Inside the venv add the files :
  - new.py 
  - chatbot.py
  - intents.json
 - Install the necessary dependencies :
   - numpy
   - tensorflow
   - nltk
- command to install dependencies -
```bash
pip install <MODULE_NAME>
```
## Run

- Run new.py first to train and create models.(Trainer)
- Then run the chatbot.py file.(Main Module)
- Command to run the py files:
```bash
& "path_to_project_directory/Scripts/python.exe" "path_to_project_directory/<file>"
```
- Provide prompts directly in cmd line arguments.

## Notes

- This is a small sample data-set.
- Populate the data-set further to help better the AI responses.
- Don't forget to train with the new data-set before running the chatbot.
